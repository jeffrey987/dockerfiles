dnscrypt
========

[DNSCrypt][1] is a protocol that encrypts, authenticates and optionally anonymizes
communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS
spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate
from the chosen DNS resolver and havenâ€™t been tampered with.
